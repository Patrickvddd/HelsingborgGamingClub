# Wireframes

The wireframes for HGC were created in Balsamiq. it covers both mobile and desktop sites. The final site is changed quite a lot on mobile and slightly on desktop from the wireframes due to changes in design that looked better and unfixable bugs.

# Site Structure

HGC has only one page, the design choice for this was because all the infomation that users would want would easily be able too fit on one page without any clutter. For this one page there are 3 main sections all with relevent infomation the user would want when going too this website.

# Design Choices
`###` typography    

For the main Heading i chose 'Bebas Neue' a Clear and concise font making sure too prioritise readability as much as possible. For the rest of the page i used 'Madimi One' a much more playful font i wanted too give readers the impression that although its a competitive enviroment everyone is welcome and it fun place too be.

`###` Colour Scheme

The colours i used for the Project are based off of the Sk√•ne Flag and the Helsingborg Football club Helsingborg IF.

# Features

HGC's site is set up easy too use, quick too navigate and simple too get in touch. It has many features that the user can use too do such things as a navigation bar and a simple contact form.

## Existing features
 
### Header and Navigation bar

At the top of all the pages in the site the nav bar, it is fully responsive and contains links to all the sections of the site to enable ease of navigation in one simple location.
The Header isnt clickable as i decided too make only one page and that seemed pointless however if i were too make more pages the header would of been a link.
